## Why PDF2HTML?

PDF2HTML is easy to use and reliably preserves the contents of the PDF in the HTML output.
PDF fonts are mapped to the appropriate system fonts with style, size and kerning to make
accurate fit. PDF tables with and without PDF table structures are detected and converted
to HTML tables automatically. Single and multi-column pages are converted to equivalent
structures with text flow preserved to facilitate editing. Graphics are converted authentically
and placed accurately on the page.

PDF2HTML can be used in server environments and is also suitable for use in batch conversion workflows.
